## First code entry
Hello World

## Week 3:
Thursday - Video-graph. We videoed each other on our phones and put them together in a line on the floor and pressed play.  Reflective questions: How did you feel as a subject of a video? Did you notice your ego? How are we evolving with this device? How could we draw this activity? Did you feel more attachment to the phone than to your image?

## Second code entry
Dogs age

## Week 4:
Monday - Today Roman has us in a circle where we had to tell the group our name and what we did in the weekend and our project idea.  The Agile Standup Method.  It was a effective way of listening and contributing.

Thursday - Exercise teaching important lessons about software development process and prototyping. Today we had a tower challenge to build the tallest tower out of 20 spagetti sticks, 1m string, 1m tape and a marshmallow.  We split into groups. I changed out of my usual group and joined a group needing another person but really glad that I did as we won the challenge (in our class) It was great colaborating with a group out of my age zone. Things I became aware of was Keep It Simple, Be Aware of Time to Completion, Build from the Top Down and Choose your team carefully (haha). 

## Week 5:
Monday - All about the Koans.
