# Reflective Journal

## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a free coding community developed by MIT. Mostly used by children for learning coding language using a simple visual interface it allows users to create digital stories, games, and animations.

Scratch promotes computational thinking and problem solving skills; creative teaching and learning; self-expression and collaboration; and equity in computing.

### What is visual programming?
Visual programming is a programming language which allows the user to create a program using visual blocks.

### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?
KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid


### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
Project in development
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/722777555

## Week 2:
Started Python.

### What is git?
Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.

### What is GitHub?
 GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
 
## First code entry
Hello World - An introduction to python coding.
https://github.com/Ravenworks6/week2ResearchRepoDemo/blob/2a90b010dd1c5480835b838cecc8a3fdc90ddf87/code/python/helloworld.py

## Week 3:
Thursday - Video-graph. We videoed each other on our phones and put them together in a line on the floor and pressed play.  Reflective questions: How did you feel as a subject of a video? Did you notice your ego? How are we evolving with this device? How could we draw this activity? Did you feel more attachment to the phone than to your image?

## Second code entry
Dogs age - I googled this one as I hadnt even started learning python let alone write a program.  The youtube video I watched on this was too complex for being a simple equation so I ended up cobbling it together instinctively.  It did not work so I had some help with another student who helped me define the float and fix the calculation to subtract 2 from the dogs age.

## Week 4:
Monday - Today Roman has us in a circle where we had to tell the group our name and what we did in the weekend and our project idea.  The Agile Standup Method.  It was a effective way of listening and contributing.

Thursday - Exercise teaching important lessons about software development process and prototyping. Today we had a tower challenge to build the tallest tower out of 20 spagetti sticks, 1m string, 1m tape and a marshmallow.  We split into groups. I changed out of my usual group and joined a group needing another person but really glad that I did as we won the challenge (in our class) It was great colaborating with a group out of my age zone. Things I became aware of was Keep It Simple, Be Aware of Time to Completion, Build from the Top Down and Choose your team carefully (haha). 

## Week 5:
Monday - All about the Koans.

## Week 6:
Submitting the IT Assignment on Networking this week so have little time to do development but have lots of ideas.  Recycling Website, On Screen Keyboard and Virtual Keyboard for my super secret Keyboard project which I may not submit but still work on as a side project.  Bit ambitious but that's me flying before I can walk. Watch this space!

## Week 7:
IT assignment submitted learnt so much and realised that my tech knowledge is so old! Its like dial-up when everybody is fibre! Going to implement some tech I learnt in my own network which would make my boy happy that wi-fi will finally be able to reach his room. Learnt some Figma to create the recycling website and got most of it done in the weekend but oh gosh the content took the longest to make up. Designed on the fly and did no pen to paper because of my time restrictions.  Feels like Im back in the design studio with time allocation being near nothing.  I feel like a traitor to my Adobe programs tho.  Haven't been able to use them for anything in coding or mockups but it's good to learn new things and break the 0 trust barrier of cloud...I think.  The software project is due this week and have been enjoying talking with others on their projects.

Wednesday - Not happy at all! Went into the lab in hopes that all my blind coding would work on the lab computers cause they didnt on my mac. I dont understand how I an installation of python 3.10.7 kept using 3.8.9. I felt like Ive done 101 things to try and fix it but everytime I type python --version it displays @#$^%$$^ 3.8.9.

Come to realise online python tutorials do not work as expected.....AT ALL! Maybe because it's a tutorial for 3.10.7  @#*&!$^$#$%&*(*&^%$#@#$%^&*(!!!!  Tried to cope by turning up the volume on my earbuds and diving headfirst into the mosh pit of python code. Got it working but there is something wrong with Buttons, the background stays grey no matter what colour you pick.
